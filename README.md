# board_game_sim.py

Feb 2, 2025

This should all check out into a folder called "board_game_sim"
To run, open a console in the that dir type: 

python3 run_board_game.py

if python3 isn't installed it won't start, but you could try w/
python or python2. python3 is 'free' though - recommend just download
