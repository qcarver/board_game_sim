# board_game_sim.py

Jan 18, 2025

This should all check out into a folder called "board_game_sim"
The file with the superlong name needs to be moved 'up' one
(that is it should be parallel with the board_game_sim folder).
then rename it to just 'run_board_game.py' (no single quotes)
in linux with python3 installed, go to the directory where
run_board_game.py is. From a console type `python3 run_board_game.py`
if python3 isn't installed it won't start, but you could try w/
python or python2. python3 is 'free' though - recommend just download
